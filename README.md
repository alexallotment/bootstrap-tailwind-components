# Bootstrap Tailwind components
## Tailwind components for common Bootstrap classes 

## But why?

I really like Tailwind but Bootstrap has been my goto CSS framework for last decades or so. I have also read and talked to people thinking that switching to Tailwind has ha steep(ish) learning curve and the benefits might not be visible in the first hours.

So I made this so you can still get going with some common bootstrap components and have something visible immeditaly. 

However, this is by far not complete and that is not the point. It should just help you to get a smoother transition.

## How to install

Basically you just need to follow the [Tailwind install guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and copy the classes from this repo to your own project.

## JS

You can either pick the normal Bootstrap JS or use the smaller jQuery free [Bootstrap Native library](https://thednp.github.io/bootstrap.native/)
